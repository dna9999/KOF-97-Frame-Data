KOF97全人物帧数据手册（KOF97 Complete Character Frame Data Manual）
如果你能把帧数表改编成一个能在FBA模拟器帧数显示框中运行的Lua脚本，并且愿意分享，可以通过GitHub联系我。谢谢）

KOF97 Frame Data (Complete Character Data)

(These TXT files include the following data: attack frames, walk/run speeds, jump heights, recovery/dodge frames, and defense stun data.) 

This repository contains the original frame data for all characters in KOF97. The frame data files are provided in their original format (Chinese TXT). If you are not familiar with the language, you can use any translation tool (e.g., Google Translate, DeepL) to understand the contents.

Feel free to explore and utilize the data as needed. If you have questions, please reach out via the Issues tab.

If you manage to adapt the frame data into a Lua script that works in the FBA emulator’s frame display and you’d like to share it, feel free to reach out to me on GitHub. Thank you!
