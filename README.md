KOF97 Frame Data (Complete Character Data)

This repository contains the original frame data for all characters in KOF97. The frame data files are provided in their original format (Chinese TXT). If you are not familiar with the language, you can use any translation tool (e.g., Google Translate, DeepL) to understand the contents.

Feel free to explore and utilize the data as needed. If you have questions, please reach out via the Issues tab.
If you manage to adapt the frame data into a Lua script that works in the FBA emulator’s frame display, and you’d like to share it, feel free to send it to my email: dengfeng287@gmail.com. Thank you!
